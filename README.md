# Unofficial Rust zmqRemoteApi

This client support the coppeliasim **4.4.0** version

A Rust ZeroMQ remote API for coppeliasim

to run tests

```bash
cargo test
```

to run an example:
make sure to open the correct coppeliasim scene and
run the cargo command:

```bash
cargo run --example=simple_test
```

Perhaps you want to see the zmq communication logs.
There is two logs levels:

- level 1: debug, debug level you will see the request in json format
- level 2: trace, trace level you will see the request in json and bytes format

```bash
RUST_LOG="trace" cargo run --example=simple_test
```

## Porting C++ client to Rust client

The **RemoteAPIObjects.h** has 3750 lines of code, so to port all the
functions, I create a kind of [c_transpiler](c_transpiler/).

## diferences between C++ client and Rust client

At moment the only difference encountered is in

```c++
std::vector<uint8_t> getStringSignal(std::string signalName);
```

in rust the function returns a std::String. I haven't observed any
examples where the function returns a block of bytes.

## running the opencv example

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/fo8G43WZQ6c/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/fo8G43WZQ6c)

## Get started

create a new rust project:

```bash
cargo new new_project
```

add this crate at your cargo.toml :

```toml
# the branch is the coppelia version
zmq_remote_api = { git = "https://github.com/samuel-cavalcanti/rust_zmqRemoteApi", branch = "CoppeliaSim_4.4.0"}

```

See this simple [example](examples/get_simulation_time.rs) to understand how to use this create.
